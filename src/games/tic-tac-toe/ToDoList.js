    1) do some quick styling so that when the buttons are clicked the background changes
    2) make player turns (player 1 gets blue background, player 2 gets red)
    3) add player turns into the playing equation 
        when its player 1 turns, the cards are added both to the played Squares, and to player 1 squares
    4) add game over to when there are three in a row
        1,2,3
        4,5,6
        7,8,9
        1,4,7
        2,5,8
        3,6,9
        1,5,9
        3,5,7
        these are the only possible wins(anything else is a draw)
    5) when a draw occurs ask if players would like to restart game
